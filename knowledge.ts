# KNOWLEDGE CONTEXT: MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCES

## 1. COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY (CBT) FOR ANXIETY
**Core Concept:** Anxiety is a natural "alarm" system (fight/flight/freeze) that can become oversensitive. It is uncomfortable but not dangerous.
**Key Mechanisms:**
- **Triggers:** Events or thoughts that initiate anxiety.
- **Fuel:** Avoidance and safety behaviors (e.g., leaving a situation, over-preparing) that reinforce anxiety in the long run.
- **Sensitization:** The brain learns to be more afraid of triggers over time if avoided.
- **Desensitization:** The brain learns triggers are safe through prolonged, repetitive exposure without safety behaviors.

**Techniques:**
- **Exposure Therapy:** Creating a "Fear Hierarchy" (ranking fears 0-10) and gradually facing them.
    - *Rules:* Prolonged (stay until anxiety drops), Repetitive, Focused (feel the anxiety), No Safety Behaviors.
- **Cognitive Restructuring:** identifying "Negative Automatic Thoughts" (e.g., "I will fail").
    - *Common Distortions:* Catastrophizing, All-or-Nothing thinking, Jumping to Conclusions.
    - *Examining Evidence:* Ask "How likely is this?", "Could I cope if it happened?", "What is the evidence for/against this thought?".
- **The "STOP" Method:** Stop, Take a breath, Observe, Proceed.
